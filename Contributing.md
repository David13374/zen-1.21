## Helpful Information for Contributors

There is a certain style of code that we prefer and many utilities exist to make your coding experience easier.

### EventBus
```kotlin
// Feature class specific
register<Event>(priority = 1000) {
    if (condition) {
        fn()
    }
}

createCustomEvent<RenderEvent>("hudRender", priority = 500) {
    // custom HUD rendering code
}

registerEvent("hudRender") // enable the custom event
unregisterEvent("hudRender") // disable the custom event

// Global config-based registration
configRegister<Event>("configKey", priority = 1000) {
    // only runs when config value (boolean) is enabled
}

configRegister<Event>("configKey", enabledIndices = setOf(1, 2, 3)) {
    // only runs when hotkeys config value (Dropdown) has indices 1, 2, or 3 selected
}

configRegister<Event>("configKey", requiredIndex = 2) {
    // only runs when config value (MultiCheckBox) contains index 2
}

EventBus.register<Event> (priority = 1000, {
    // add = false means it does not automatically get registered, and you have to register/unregister
}, add = false)
```

### Loops
```kotlin
// Feature class specific - Use setupLoops for automatic registration/unregistration
object MyFeature : Feature("configKey") {
    override fun initialize() {
        setupLoops {
            // Client tick loops (20 TPS)
            loop<ClientTick>(intervalTicks = 20) {
                player?.let { p ->
                    if (p.health < 10) ChatUtils.addMessage("Low health!")
                }
            }

            // Server tick loops
            loop<ServerTick>(intervalTicks = 100) { 
                fn()
            }

            // Timer loops (millisecond precision)
            loop<Timer>(intervalMs = 1000) {
                fn()
            }

            // Dynamic loops with variable delays - it checks delay on every loop
            loopDynamic<ClientTick>(
                delay = { if (variable) 1L else 20L },
                stop = { !isEnabled() }
            ) {
                fn()
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Note:** Always use `setupLoops { }` in your feature's initialize block. This ensures loops are automatically started when the feature is enabled and stopped when disabled, preventing memory leaks and unnecessary processing.
### Config
```kotlin
object MyFeature : Feature("configKey") {
    override fun addConfig(configUI: ConfigUI): ConfigUI {
        return configUI
            .addElement("Category", "Section/Feature", "Sub categories" /* OR null */, ConfigElement(
                "configKey",
                "Title" /* OR null */,
                ElementType
            ), isSectionToggle = Boolean)
    }
}
```
